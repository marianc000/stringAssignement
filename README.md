# What is copied when a string is assigned â€” the string or the reference?

Sample code for my post https://marian-caikovski.medium.com/what-is-copied-when-a-string-is-assigned-the-string-or-the-reference-73ac213c1466 about retrieving the totlal memory used by a web page. 
When you assign a string variable to another variable, you assign a reference to the string and not its value. The string is not copied.
